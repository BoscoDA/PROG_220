The Fibonacci Problem:
The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers starting at zero that increases by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence together. It is an infinite set
Your job is to calculate the nth number in the fibonacci sequence. For example, if you input 2 you should get 1 and if you input 6 you should get 8 and so on and so forth

in the accompanying c file you have a fibonnaci function. that currrently takes in an integer and returns 0; implement this function so the test cases pass

The test cases are defined in the main method. 

Assignment:
- implement fibonnaci method to calculate the nth number in the sequence
- write 2 of your own test cases like the already defined ones
